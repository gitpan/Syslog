Revision history for Perl extension Unix::Syslog.

0.95  Wed Feb 07 21:43:00 2001
        - (Syslog.pm) Fixed a message formatting bug in the syslog()
          wrapper (reported by Eric Kuzniar <kuzniar@server.airchek.com>
	  and partly fixed by Mike DeVaynes
	  <mike@radon.com>). Multiple expansion (sprintf,syslog) of
	  format string and arguments, in some cases resulted in
	  malformed messages.

	- (test.pl) Added some tests related to that bug fix 

        - (README) Added some details about the test suite.

0.94  Sun Aug 20 23:25:00 2000
	- (Makefile.PL) Added '-lc' to LIBS which seems to be
          necessary to compile Unix::Syslog on NEC EWS4800 machines
          (reported by Oota Toshiya <oota@ppd.fc.nec.co.jp>).

        - (Syslog.pm) Fixed severe bug in documentation of
          setlogmask() and the according macros.

        - (README) FAQ synched with pod section in Syslog.pm
